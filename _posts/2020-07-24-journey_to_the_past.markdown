No, I'm not embarrassed to be using an Anastasia reference as the title for my first-ever blog post. I tried to come up with a theater-related pun for the name of my entire blog and failed, but this one fit the bill for my first topic.

I'm learning to code. 

I grew up in Los Altos, California, the town where Steve Jobs founded Apple Computers in his garage. The heart of Silicon Valley. I've been into tech since before I can remember. I've been a Mac user for life. I came of age with technology and the internet. Facebook was founded during my freshman year at NYU. The iPhone first premiered the week I graduated college and began my acting career in New York City. 

You see, that's where tech and I diverged. I began acting at the age of five as a munchkin in *The Wizard of Oz*, and I never stopped. If it weren't for this preoccupation with theater, I likely would have "jumped into tech" decades ago. Theater is a fulfilling yet draining career path. Your current achievement is never enough. It's always, "What's next?" And sometimes "what's next" doesn't come for weeks, or months, or years. So I need something more stable.

It's ironic: in the 5th Grade I was in a play called *Cheaper by the Dozen,* based on the book of the same name. I was so fascinated by the show that I did a book report on the main character, Frank Gilbreth, who was an early advocate of scientific management and a pioneer of time and motion study. Even as a kid, this all made sense to me. It was logical. It was straight forward. It was the furthest thing from being artistic. 

It had an impact on the type of person I have become. It's been in the background all my life, and now I'm ready to make it one of my focuses as I begin a journey towards becoming a software engineer. Efficiency, practicality, betterment. These are the tenets on which I'm building my career. I'm moving forward by looking backwards, at where I came from, and the passions I've neglected for so long. And I hope that this journey to the past creates a career for the future, where I can be fulfilled, and no longer drained. 

Here's hoping. Here's to coding.
